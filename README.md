#iOS 15.7.2 headers for SpringBoard (and SBHome) mainly in relation to icon layouts, folders,App Library, and Widgets, but there's so much other stuff too.
#SBDockIconListView and #SBFloatingDockIconListView
#SBIconListModel has lots of rotation methods that are new
#SBFolder related classes 
#Random Apple Internalz

NOTE: These were all collected from an iPhone 7+ using the palera1n jailbreak, with tweaks ON.  Most of the headers should have minimal impact,
but it wouldn't be a bad idea to double check.  I pretty much only have tweaks I mnade myself installed, so I'd recognize changes from my work.
I think Snowboard is the main one that adds to or changes some headers, but even that has very few diffs
